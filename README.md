Build LLM workflows like normal Python while keeping a full audit trail by default.

> Visit https://getrepublic.org for concepts, guides, and API reference.

Republic is a **tape-first** LLM client: messages, tool calls, tool results, errors, and usage are all recorded as structured data. You can make the workflow explicit first, then decide where intelligence should be added.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install republic
```

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import os

from republic import LLM

api_key = os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise RuntimeError("Set LLM_API_KEY before running this example.")

llm = LLM(model="openrouter:openrouter/free", api_key=api_key)
result = llm.chat("Describe Republic in one sentence.", max_tokens=48)
print(result)
```

## Why It Feels Natural

- **Plain Python**: The main flow is regular functions and branches, no extra DSL.
- **Unified API surface**: Use the same `chat/tool_calls/run_tools/stream/stream_events` methods across completion, responses, and messages transports.
- **Tools without magic**: Supports both automatic and manual tool execution with clear debugging and auditing.
- **Tape-first memory**: Use anchor/handoff to bound context windows and replay full evidence.
- **Event streaming**: Subscribe to text deltas, tool calls, tool results, usage, and final state.

## Development

```bash
make check
make test
```
