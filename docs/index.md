## Why Republic?

It's a opinionated AI stack, built from scratch.

## Real-World Examples

We provide a complete example refactoring **Google's Gemini CLI system prompt** into a maintainable modular architecture.

- **Messy Gemini CLI system prompt** → **Modular components**
- **Monolithic structure** → **Reusable snippets**  
- **Hard-coded logic** → **Environment-aware templates**
