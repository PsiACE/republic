# Philosophy

Republic is built on three core principles that guide every design decision.

## Clear Separation of Concerns

**Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility.**

Complex AI systems often become tangled webs of interdependent code. Republic enforces clear boundaries:

- **Snippets**: Reusable content fragments
- **Templates**: Dynamic logic and rendering
- **Prompts**: Complete, ready-to-use outputs
- **Functions**: Business logic and data processing

This separation makes systems easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## Environment Awareness

**Dynamic behavior based on deployment context.**

AI systems need different behavior in development vs. production. Republic makes this explicit:

- **Configuration-driven**: Environment settings in `prompts.toml`
- **Template integration**: Conditional logic based on environment
- **Validation**: Ensure consistency across environments
- **Debugging**: Enhanced output in development mode

## Composable Design

**Build complex prompts from simple, reusable components.**

The best software systems are built from small, focused components that work together. Republic applies this principle to prompt engineering:

- **Modular**: Small pieces that do one thing well
- **Reusable**: Components work across different contexts
- **Testable**: Easy to validate individual components
- **Scalable**: Complexity grows linearly, not exponentially

## Inspiration

Republic draws inspiration from successful software patterns:

- **Unix philosophy**: Small tools that do one thing well
- **Modern web frameworks**: Convention over configuration
- **Infrastructure as code**: Declarative, version-controlled systems
- **Component architectures**: Reusable, composable building blocks

## The Result

The agentic system that feels natural to developers, scales with your needs, and maintains clarity even as complexity grows.

*Simple things should be simple. Complex things should be possible.*
